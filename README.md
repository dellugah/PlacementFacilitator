Web API Description

I designed and implemented a RESTful Web API using Java (Spring Boot) that connected the front end with the database.
The API handled core operations such as creating, reading, updating, and deleting records (CRUD), while enforcing validation and secure communication.
It supported smooth data flow between the Angular front end and the MySQL database, enabling users to interact with the application reliably.

The API was designed to streamline and automate the hiring process for placement students. 
Although not all features were completed before my graduation, I continued development independently for some time afterward. 
However, with limited feedback and the course coordinatorâ€™s availability, the project eventually lost momentum and became unfeasible to continue.
